# CSS --- Animation

CSS animations allow you to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another.

## Key Concepts

- `@keyframes`: Defines the animation sequence.
- `animation-name`: Specifies the name of the `@keyframes` to use.
- `animation-duration`: Sets how long the animation takes to complete one cycle.
- `animation-iteration-count`: Sets how many times the animation should repeat.
- `animation-delay`, `animation-timing-function`, and more: Control the timing and behavior.
